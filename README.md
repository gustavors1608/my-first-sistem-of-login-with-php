# my-first-sistem-of-login-with-php
my first login system made with php it saves the user data in 3 different files one with password another with username and one with email, must have several security and logic errors, but it was one of my first projects I programmed in php ... I accept help and tips.
To use, put these files in a folder inside the root file of your localhost for example or even on your site (I am not responsible for any hacks and errors arising) done so just open the index.php file in your web browser by your host location or url.
